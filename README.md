### Description of App
The application will help users to plan social meet-ups by allowing users to create scheduled plans including the location, time, attending members, and topic/interest of the meeting. The meetings can either be private among friends or a public gathering for people who have similar interests. There will be an algorithm for the application that will suggest public meetings to the user based on their personal interests in their profile and allow them to meet new people. The main purpose of this app will be to allow users to schedule activities that work for everybody by keeping track of everyone’s times of availability. The application will also include a calendar view and map view to display planned meet-ups. There will also be an interactive map that allows users to create plans and suggest locations for their meet-ups. Lastly there will be a voice chat and messaging service that allows users to discuss their meet-ups.

### 5 Technical Challenges
Integrating the application 
This will be challenging due to understanding how each component will interact with another component and understanding how to implement the components in a way that will allow them to communicate with each other.
React 
Most of us are not familiar with it which will shift more work to the team members who are familiar with using React and take time for the new users to learn it.
The interactive map feature
This feature will take time to learn, practice, and implement it into the application, involving a lot of trial and error until it is implemented exactly as we need it.
Creating a suggestions algorithm 
We will need to think about what factors to consider when suggesting meetings to users and also to suggest meet-up locations when creating new meetings. There is also the need to understand how to incorporate this algorithm with various components of the app such as the app and the dashboard.
Learning the different APIs 
There will be various APIs used throughout this project which will take plenty of time to learn and practice with them. We will need to also learn how we can use them to implement specific features that fit our applications requirements.
